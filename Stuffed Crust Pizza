Yield: 2 16-inch pizzas

Ingredients
Original recipe (1X) yields 24 servings
5 cups bread flour, divided, or as needed
1 (12 fluid ounce) can or bottle warm beer
Â¼ cup warm water
3 tablespoons shortening
1 tablespoon instant yeast
1 tablespoon brown sugar
2 teaspoons salt
1 teaspoon garlic powder
1 teaspoon onion powder
1 tablespoon olive oil, or to taste, divided
2 tablespoons cornmeal, or as needed
16 sticks string cheese

Directions
Combine 4 cups bread flour, beer, water, shortening, yeast, brown sugar, salt, garlic powder, and onion powder in the bowl of a stand mixer fitted with a dough hook attachment; mix until combined. With the mixer running, add remaining flour, a little at a time, until dough pulls away from the sides of the bowl and forms into a ball, about 2 minutes.

Lightly grease a large bowl with 1 teaspoon olive oil. Place dough into the bowl. Cover with a clean towel and let rise until doubled in size, about 1 hour.

Grease 2 pizza pans with remaining 2 teaspoons olive oil; dust with cornmeal.

Punch dough down gently and divide into 2 equal portions. Place each portion onto a prepared pan. Cover and let rest for about 5 minutes.

Stretch each dough out 1 inch past the edge of the pan. If dough shrinks back when stretched, cover and let rest for 5 more minutes before stretching again.

Arrange 8 sticks cheese, ends touching, around the edge of 1 pan. Fold overhang over cheese and press dough to seal. Repeat with the second pan.

Tips
Substitute olive oil for shortening if desired.
Substitute 2 cups shredded cheese for string cheese if desired.

To Bake Pizzas:
Bake pizzas in a preheated 400 degrees F (200 degrees C) oven until the center is set and crust is crispy, about 30 minutes.
