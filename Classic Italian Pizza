Toppings (per pizza)
250g flour (preferably '00'), plus extra for dusting
250g plain wholemeal flour
7g dried fast-acting yeast
325ml warm water
1 tbsp caster sugar
1.5 tbsp olive oil
2 x 400g can chopped tomatoes, drained
3 tbsp tomato puree
3 cloves garlic, peeled
2 tsp sugar
1 tsp sea salt
1 tsp dried oragano
1 tbsp chopped basil leaves (or 1 tsp dried)
Pinch of black pepper
50g blue cheese
50g buffalo mozzarella
One large mushroom, sliced
Small handful cherry tomatoes, halved
50g parmesan, finely grated

Method
step 1
To make the dough, mix the yeast with the warm water, sugar and oil and leave for 1-2 minutes. Add the flours into a mixing bowl with 1/2 tsp salt and briefly mix before making a well ready for the liquids. Pour in the yeast mixture and stir into the flour using a fork, until the mixture comes together and can be finished off by hand. Knead the dough for 3-4 minutes on a floured surface, then place in a clean, lightly oiled mixing bowl. Cover the bowl with a damp tea towel and leave in a warm place for 1 hour or until it has risen to double its size.
step 2
Meanwhile, make the tomato sauce by blending all of the ingredients together.
step 3
Preheat the oven to 240°C (220°C fan, gas mark 9). Place the dough back onto a floured surface and knead for another minute to knock the air out. Any dough not used immediately can be refrigerated for up to 2 days - allowing to stand for 2 hours before making the pizzas.
step 4
Roll out the dough and place on a large baking tray. Spread the tomato base over the pizza before topping with the blue cheese and mozzarella, then the mushrooms and cherry tomatoes.
step 5
Cook in the hot oven for around 15 minutes or until the dough is crisp around the edges. Top with the parmesan and a good grating of pepper and serve.

optional: add olive and fresh basil as topping
